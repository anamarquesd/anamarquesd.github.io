Although we usually don’t notice, from the moment our mobile phones are powered on, they are sharing information all the time. Mainly, what they share is its own location, and yes, even if your GPS is off, your mobile phone location is being tracked anyway. 

What happens is that you cellphone is communicating with your network towers all the time. By observing the signal strength that one device have with different towers, by triangulation, it’s possible to determine where the device is located, very often with an accuracy of one block in a city. This information can only be accessed by the mobile operator, how ever, with law enforcement, the government can have access to those. A Green party politician in Germany, called Malte Spitz sued his mobile operator, in order to have six months of his mobile data, and then he publically shared it at ZEIT ONLINE(http://www.zeit.de/datenschutz/malte-spitz-data-retention), to make people aware about this lack of privacy we live with.

Another way to track a mobile phone is by its Wi-Fi, or Bluetooth. These signals have a shorter range, such as within in a room or a building. Every device has a unique serial number, called MAC address, which can be observed in wireless signals even if a device is not connected to a network. The device transmits signals that include the MAC address, whenever the Wi-Fi is turned on. This kind of tracking is not so useful for government surveillance, but has been used for commercial tracking applications.
