Ludwig Mies van der Rohe designed in 1956, the new home for the School of Architecture and Institute of Design. He wanted to produce a universal space, that allowed more integration and that could be easily adapted to changes. In order to achieve that, Crown Hall main floor has a free-column plan of 120’ x 220’ and the interior divisions are made by free-standing oak partitions. The roof of the building is suspended by four steel plate girders, that are supported by eight columns, spaced at 60 foot intervals.

The division with the exterior is made with glass. In the bottom line was used a translucent glass with a sandblasted inner layer, that would avoid visual contact with the exterior and therefore student’s distraction, but allows light to come inside in a diffuse way. For the upper line transparent glass was used to allow a view to the sky and to the branch’s of the trees closer to the building.

S. R. Crown Hall is definitely considered a masterpiece. In 1997 it was declared a City of Chicago Landmark and in 2001, a National Historic Landmark, even though the building was not 50 years yet.
