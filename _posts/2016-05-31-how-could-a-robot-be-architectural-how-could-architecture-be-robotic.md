title: "How could a robot be architectural? How could architecture be robotic?"

First of all, what is the difference between these two questions? When I think about the first one, I imagine people living inside some crazy robot that can moves and adapt to different environments. Something like the walking city proposed by Ron Herron in 1964, for the Archigram. His idea was that the cities could move when the resources at some place were exhausted, and that they could concentrate forming larger cities, or disperse, when needed.

But when I think about an architecture that can be robotic, I think about something more tangible, that don’t look so far away from the present, that in fact, already exist, in a way so timid, that the robotic aspect is almost unnoticed, while architecture and art surpasses it. The first example, of an existing architecture like that I would like to mention are the automatic shading devices at façades. We can find more then one example of this new architecture improvement, but one that I really like is the one completed in 2012 at the Al Bahr Towers, by Aedas Architects. The tower has a shading system to protect the glass façade against heat gain that changes along the day, based on the sun position. The video at the following link talk more about the project: (If you just want to see the motion jump to 1:23 minute)

A second example I would like to mention is a more ludic, less functional façade, developed for the Sochi 2014 Winter Olympics. The building has a structure that can transform in three dimensions and form the faces of visitors. The structure changes every minute, based on the images captured by a 3D camera, within the building. This video shows better how the process work:
