title: "What is architecture?"

I always think that a good way to define a word is to start by it’s origin. Well, architecture comes from architect, that comes from the Greek word “arkhitekton”, which means "master builder, director of works”. The word itself it’s an invention of the modern world, given that before the renascence, buildings weren’t planned buy a “director” but were an achievement of a group. That is the reason why we don’t have famous architects to talk about before the XIV century, although we do have famous architecture.

While not associated with the word etymology, art is intrinsically related to architecture, and mentioned in most of the word definitions. But what is the relationship between architecture and art about? I would like to quote Steven Holl and say that “While artists work from the real to the abstract, architects must work from the abstract to the real.”. I really like that quote, because I do agree that architecture differs from other types of art, but unlikely some people say, I don’t think the difference is because architecture has a “real” function while other arts are “just” for entertainment, considering that this can be far from true. What really differs architecture is that it has to be real and tangible. And what really makes it an art? I would say is that like all other kind of arts, it should serve to inspire the human kind.
