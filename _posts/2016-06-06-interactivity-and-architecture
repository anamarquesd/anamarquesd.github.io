title: "Interactivity and Architecture"

The idea of interactive art has been out here for a while now, but the advances of technology had improved it and expanded it. And now this idea has started to expand to architecture.

What is fascinating about this relationship between architecture and interactivity is that the building is no longer something finished and static, instead, is something in constant change and the most amazing part is that anyone can contribute with those changes. 
Of course there are other kinds of interactivity where instead of people there are other things contributing to the changes, like weather, but on this post I’ll focus on the ones where people are the changing factor, because it is what I’m interested in investigating.

The first example I want to talk about is the Enteractive, designed in 2006 by <a href="http://www.electroland.net/#/enteractive/">"Electroland"</a> . The project is composed of a large interactive carpet made with LED, which lights on according to people movement on it, and a LED façade that lights on according to the carpet.

The Dream Cube, designed by ESI Design (http://www.esidesign.com/work/shanghai-2010-expo-corporation-pavilion) for the 2010 World Expo is similar to the Enteractive but in a larger scale, with a lot more LEDs. In a 360 theater, visitors can take part in changing the exterior of the building, considering the LED structure pulses with color and dynamic patterns in response to visitors’ movements.

Evoke, created by Haque Design + Research (http://www.haque.co.uk/evoke.php) for Illuminating York 2007 differs from the other two projects because instead of LEDs it’s a projection and instead of changing according to people’s movement, it changes according to their voices. The interesting is that different sounds causes different effects, a staccato chirping will result in a completely different effects to a long howl, for example.

Something interesting to note about all three examples is that the visual effects shown are always a result of a collective work. In theory they could all work with one person only, but its never shown like that, because the result would not be as intriguing.
