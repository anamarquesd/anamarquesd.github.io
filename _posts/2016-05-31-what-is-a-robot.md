title: "What is a Robot?"

I would like to start by saying that despite what movies may show us most of times, Robots do not have to have a humanoid form, and actually, most of existing robots don’t. What differs a robot from a regular machine is that it has some intelligence, derived from programming, and it’s sensible to its environment. They are used to replace man in activities that might be dangerous, or too nasty, or maybe just boring.
